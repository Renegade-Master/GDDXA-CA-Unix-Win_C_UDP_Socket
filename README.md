## To Add a New Commit  
1. Create a new Branch with a name that is something to do with the change you intend to make.  (e.g. `feature\myNewFeature`)
2. Work in your branch.
3. When your work is complete, submit a **PULL REQUEST** to `master` branch.
4. At least one other person must approve the PULL REQUEST.
5. Once the PULL REQUEST is approved, the change is automatically merged into `master` branch.
6. Remember that you will be asked to approve other's work, as well as them approve yours.  This is mutual learning.
